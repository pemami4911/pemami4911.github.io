## About Me

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Florida advised by [Dr. Sanjay Ranka](https://sites.google.com/site/sanjayranka/) and [Dr. Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/bio.html). My research is motivated by a desire to build computational vision systems that mimic how humans perceive the world. I also enjoy collaborating on inter-disciplinary projects where I apply machine learning to [transportation engineering](http://avian.essie.ufl.edu/) and [cybersecurity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13466). My thesis research is on the development of efficient neural algorithms for object-centric video scene understanding, with applications to traffic signal control and model-based reinforcement learning.

I'm a [Florida McKnight Fellow](http://fefonline.org/mdf.html). The McKnight Doctoral Fellowship program aims to address the under-representation of African American and Hispanic faculty in the state of Florida. I'm always looking for ways in which I can better promote diversity and inclusivity in the field of computing. 

Here's my [CV](pdfs/cv.pdf) and [resume](pdfs/resume.pdf).
