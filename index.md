I am a machine learning research scientist at the [National Renewable Energy Lab](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) with broad expertise in deep learning and foundation models. I lead a US Dept. of Energy ASCR-funded AI for Science project where we are researching hallucination mitigation, probabilistic reasoning, and multimodality in conversational Assistants. Our vision is to build Assistants that aid scientists by accelerating computational experiment-driven discovery. At NREL, I have applied my expertise in areas including building energy management and protein engineering. My contributions at NREL have been recognized with an Outstanding Mentor Award (2023) and a Postdoctoral Publication Award (2024).
