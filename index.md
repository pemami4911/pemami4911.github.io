## About Me

I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Florida advised by [Dr. Sanjay Ranka](https://sites.google.com/site/sanjayranka/) and [Dr. Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/bio.html). My research interests are motivated by a desire to understand human intelligence and develop machines that can learn like us. Lately, I've been working on multi-object spatiotemporal problems in computer vision, an area of machine learning where the emphasis is on building systems that have advanced visual capabilities.

I'm also a [McKnight Fellow](http://fefonline.org/mdf.html); the McKnight Doctoral Fellowship program aims to address the under-representation of African American and Hispanic faculty in the state of Florida. I'm always looking for ways in which I can better promote diversity and inclusivity in the field of computing. 

Here's my [CV](pdfs/cv.pdf).
