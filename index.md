## About Me

I am a machine learning researcher interested in representation learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and AI for social good. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida expecting to graduate in December 2021. My research has spanned topics including object-centric deep generative modeling, low-resource multi-object tracking, and traffic signal control. I'm also a [Florida McKnight Fellow](http://fefonline.org/mdf.html). During the summer of 2021, I worked as a research intern at the National Renewable Energy Lab. There, I built a tool that uses a scalable stochastic approximation method to calibrate traffic simulations and worked on new deep RL approaches for NEMA-compliant traffic signal control.
