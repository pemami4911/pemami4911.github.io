I am a machine learning researcher interested in deep generative models, reinforcement learning, and AI for clean energy. I am a research scientist at the [National Renewable Energy Lab](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) where I work on problems such as building energy management, weather and power forecasting, and discovering novel enzymes.
I'm currently studying methods (foundation models for science and neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning) and evaluation strategies for out-of-distribution generalization.
 NREL is a DOE national lab that uses AI and supercomputing to help tackle the climate crises, which I believe to be one of the most pressing challenges of our time. I graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Florida in December 2021.
