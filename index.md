I am a machine learning research scientist at the [National Renewable Energy Lab](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL). Currently, I am working on developing scientific foundation models. In the past, I have researched advances in deep generative modeling and reinforcement learning. I am broadly interested in applications of AI to clean energy systems. 

At NREL, I apply ML to real-world problems such as building energy management, weather and power forecasting, and discovering novel enzymes.
NREL is a DOE national lab that uses AI and supercomputing to help tackle the climate crises, which I believe to be one of the most pressing challenges of our time.
