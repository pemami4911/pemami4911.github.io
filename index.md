I am a machine learning researcher interested in deep generative models, neural representation learning, reinforcement learning, and AI for climate change. I am a postdoc at the [National Renewable Energy Lab](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) where I develop machine learning algorithms for problems such as building energy management, weather and power forecasting, and discovering novel enzymes. NREL is a DOE national lab that uses AI and supercomputing to help tackle the climate crises, which I believe to be one of the most pressing challenges of our time. I recently graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Florida in December 2021. My Ph.D. research was on neural scene understanding and spanned topics including: object-centric deep generative modeling, dynamic point cloud modeling, and low-resource multi-object tracking for traffic signal control.
