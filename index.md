## About Me

I am a machine learning researcher interested in deep generative models, neural representation learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and AI for climate change. Recently, I started as a postdoc at the [National Renewable Energy Lab](https://www.nrel.gov/) (NREL) where I will be developing multi-agent RL approaches to energy-efficient building control and neural algorithms for large-scale black-box optimization. NREL is a US Dept. of Energy national lab that is helping to advance our understanding of how machine learning can help tackle climate change, which I believe to be one of the most pressing scientific challenges of our time. I recently graduated with my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Florida in December 2021 with generous support from the [Florida McKnight Fellowship](http://fefonline.org/mdf.html). My Ph.D. research was on neural scene understanding and spanned topics including: object-centric deep generative modeling, dynamic point cloud modeling, and low-resource multi-object tracking for traffic signal control.
