## Control transfer instructions

Jumps take a virtual address of the instruction to jump to. Compares content of top of stack with some value. Several kinds are available:

* conditional compares to zero
* conditional compare to null
* compare top two elements on the stack
* unconditional transfer

## Stack manipulation

`dup`, `swap`, and `pop` are some self-explanatory instruction examples. 

## Method invocation

Each method invocation causes a new frame to be created. Local variables are copied into a "local variable" array.

## Object Instantiation

Call `new` with the name of the class. Then call `dup` to duplicate the reference on top of the stack, since one reference will be consumed in the call to `init`. This happens when the method invocation `invokespecial` is called, for example.

## JVM verification

It verifies the source code via type-checking. Typical errors:

* "falling off the end of the code" - missing return statement
* "unequal stack sizes" problem is that there is branching code where the alt paths have diff effects on the stack. Likely caused by `if` and `while` statements.

## Tools

* `javap` is a CLI tool for parsing class files. 
* Eclipse has a byte-code viewer.
