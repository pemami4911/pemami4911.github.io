## While loops

It can be shown (domain theory) that if the loop terminates, the function has a fixed point. Further, there is a partial order on the fixed points, the one that we want is the least fixed point. 

## Scopes

The environment models the binding between an identifier and its location (address). The `store` function maps the location to the value it contains. 

## Axiomatic Semantics

Describe programming language semantics in a way that can be used by programmers to develop correct programs. Denotational semantics is mainly of interest to program language designers.

* `java -ea -esa myprog` enables your assertions and system assertions

Hoare triple:

{precondition}
**program**
{postcondition}
